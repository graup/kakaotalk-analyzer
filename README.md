kakaotalk-analyzer
==================

Litte Python script to get statistics from KakaoTalk message export files.

This is totally work-in-progress, but I will try to only put at
least kind of functional versions up on GitHub.

How to export messages
----------------------

- In the app, go to a chatroom and select Settings -> Export Messages -> Send Text Messages Only
- Send the export to your own email account

Usage
-----

Open a console and run `python kakaotalk.py plot path-to-file.txt`
